![me]

I've been on the road since 2005, mainly developing software, but also trying to find out
my place in the world. I have a passion about software development and want to improve it the most
I can. Few years ago I started to look at companies from a whole new
perspective, trying to figure out how things work out there, after the product go live and before
I even knew it would be a project.

This is how I got here, coding and entrepreneuring at the same time. I don't look for the code as 
something worthful of itself anymore, I rather look for what it will make possible, how it will get
in ones life and change how they see and interact to the world. I try to go deep in others
mind and research as much as I can to understand better about how software can improve their lives, 
either at work or home.

I'm also an addicted reader, but I don't like to read novels or anything that doesn't improve my life in
a practical manner. A lot of what I write is based on what I read plus my own thoughts
